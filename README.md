## Features

- **Polygon Drawing**: Click to add points, click first point to close polygon
- **Multi-Input Support**: Works with mouse, touch, and pen/stylus input (Pointer Events API)
- **Class Selection**: Configurable classes with color-coded buttons (supports up to 20 classes)
- **Zoom & Pan**: 
  - Mouse wheel to zoom, Space+move to pan
  - Touch pinch zoom on mobile/tablets
  - Dedicated zoom buttons and keyboard shortcuts
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `S` - Save
  - `Z` - Undo last point
  - `X` - Delete current polygon
  - `B` - Back to previous image
  - `N` - Next image
  - `-` - Zoom out
  - `=` - Zoom in
  - `R` - Reset zoom
  - `1-9` - Select classes 0-8
  - `0` - Select class 9 (10th class)
  - `Q-P` - Select classes 10-19 (Q=class 10, W=class 11, etc.)
- **Auto-save**: Automatically saves when polygons are completed
- **Label Loading**: Loads existing labels when switching images
- **Docker Support**: Ready-to-deploy container with health checks

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors
   ```
4. Create required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir images labels
   ```
5. Add your images to the `images/` directory
6. Update `classes.txt` with your class names (one per line, supports up to 20 classes)
7. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
8. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

### Quick Start with Docker Compose
```bash
# Pull and run the pre-built image
docker-compose up -d

# Or use the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

### Manual Docker Setup
```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull rantyawset/labelez:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/images:/app/images \
  -v $(pwd)/labels:/app/labels \
  -v $(pwd)/classes.txt:/app/classes.txt \
  --name labelez-app \
  rantyawset/labelez:latest
```

### Docker Features
- **Health checks** - automatic container monitoring
- **Non-root user** - security best practices
- **Volume mounting** - persistent data storage
- **Pre-built image** - `rantyawset/labelez:latest` on Docker Hub

```

## Usage

1. **Select Class**: Click class buttons or use keyboard shortcuts (1-9, 0, Q-P)
2. **Draw Polygon**: Click to add points, click first point to close
3. **Zoom Control**: Pan (space+drag) to navigate; zoom with `/=` keys or buttons
4. **Edit**: Drag points to adjust, use Z to undo, X to delete
5. **Navigate**: Use B/N keys or buttons to switch images
6. **Save**: Press S or auto-saves when polygon is closed

### Input Methods
- **Mouse**: Standard clicking and dragging
- **Touch**: Tap to add points, pinch to zoom
- **Pen/Stylus**: Full support via Pointer Events API (Windows pen devices)

## Label Format

Labels are saved in YOLO polygon format:
```
class_id x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ...
```

Where coordinates are normalized (0-1) relative to image dimensions.

## Security Note

The `images/` and `labels/` directories are excluded from version control to protect sensitive data. Add your own images and the tool will generate labels locally.

## Final Warning

Remember: **This is AI slop code!** 🎭 It works, but it's not perfect. Use it, break it, fix it, or throw it away - it's all up to you. Just don't come crying to us when your polygons look like abstract art! 🎨
